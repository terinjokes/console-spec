# Console Standard

All web browsers, and most other JavaScript environments, have shipped some form of developer console. This standard attempts to finally define the semantics of the console APIs, in an attempt to create convergence.

A list containing some of the observed differences so far in different environments is available in [NOTES.md](NOTES.md).

## Work in progress

This specification is still in its very early stages. It is very much a work in progress.
